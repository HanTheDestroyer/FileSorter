# FileSorter
DIY file management for custom folders.

Folder names are my folder names. You can change and add folder names to both "sources" and "destinations".

Make sure that you have all the folders created prior to running it. I have not added a try block for it.

Run directly or from command line. You can also use task scheduler to automatically sort your files.

I suggest following on task scheduler;

Trigger => At log on.

Action => Start Python, Details => location of the script.
